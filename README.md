FreeBT
======

FreeBT is an open source Windows Bluetooth stack implemented by Antony C. Roberts http://www.freebt.net.

This is original FreeBT implementation with a number of my modifications in user space code.
My modifications were initially released under GNU GPL v3 license for the [Bluetooth for Microsoft Device Emulator](http://code.google.com/p/bthmsdevemul/) project and re-licensed here under the FreeBT license.

You can still download compiled FreeBT USB driver from http://code.google.com/p/bthmsdevemul/downloads/list.
