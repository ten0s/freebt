FreeBT is an open source Windows Bluetooth stack implemented by Antony C. Roberts [http://www.freebt.net](https://web.archive.org/web/20101230001311/http://freebt.net/).

This is original FreeBT implementation with a number of my changes in user space code.
My changes were initially released under GNU GPL v3 license for the
**Bluetooth for Microsoft Device Emulator** project
https://github.com/ten0s/bthmsdevemul | http://code.google.com/p/bthmsdevemul/ and
re-licensed here under the FreeBT license.

You can still download compiled FreeBT USB driver from https://code.google.com/archive/p/bthmsdevemul/downloads.
